Results and discussions 

Experimented by frequency input with a function generator at frequencies of 20 Hz, 200 Hz, 1 kHz and 2 kHz. Then measure the output signal with oscilloscope and Arduino to compare results. 
Determine the number of random variant n = 15. To keep all raw data from a serial monitor. The results of all experiments are shown in Tables 1 to 4.
